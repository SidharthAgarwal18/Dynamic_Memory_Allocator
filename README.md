# Memory-Allocation-System

## About
Three different data structures are used to build individual memory allocation systems and then the runtime between them is comapred.

In part 1, I have used Doubly Linked List to implement `allocate` and `free` functions for memory blocks. 
In part 2, Binary Search Trees are used to implement `defragment` along with the functions defined above. 
Similar functions have been implemented in part 3 but using AVL Trees.

All the codes have been implemented using `java` programming language.

## Usage
Standard java commands can be used to execute the files.
Use `javac .* file_name.java` to compile the file and `java file_name` to execute it.

Set the name of the input and output files as required in the file `Driver.java`.
The name of the input file can be set as `"./input_file_name.in"` and the name of the output file can be set as `"./output_file_name.out"`
